But your ship is rudimentary, your last fightcost you a lot, you only have some fuel and a week mining laser.
Mine asteroids to gather ressources, build powerfull modules, hunt through this sector and kill your target before it kills you.
But look out ! you are not the only danger here.

For example, you can move using a card, attack using another.

### Deck building
This game mechanic is inspired from deck building games.
During a game, you can harvest ressources from the terrain, those are usefull to build new cards.
More advanced cards need rarer ressources.
You can also upgrade you cards using special ressources, or steal cards and ressources from passive or aggressive living entity.
